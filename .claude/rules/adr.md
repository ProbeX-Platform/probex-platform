# ADRs

An ADR answers "why this and not that" for developers and companies using ProbeX. Write one only when the choice
meets the bar:

1. **Real choice** — at least two viable options.
2. **Costly to reverse** — reversing it changes something outside the component's own code:
   - the public API: exports, their signatures, options, environment variables, documented behavior;
   - the protocol: messages, fields, version, close codes, the guarantees peers rely on;
   - the packages: their boundaries or runtime dependencies;
   - what users, custom connectors or hubs have to implement.

Everything else goes straight into `docs/architecture/`, even when there were options: internal algorithms, queues,
timeouts, limits, defaults, module layout. Choices that cannot be made separately share one ADR; independent ones
get one each. A detail of an existing decision is not a new ADR. Never merge, squash or delete an accepted ADR that
is on `staging`: supersede it.

- File `docs/adr/NNNN-kebab-title.md`, next free number, no gaps. Copy `.claude/templates/adr.md` and keep its
  sections in order: Status, Context, Decision, Alternatives, Consequences.
- First heading `# NNNN. Title`; the title is ≤ 60 chars and names the decision, not the topic.
- Status line: `<status> · YYYY-MM-DD`, where status is `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Deprecated` or
  `Superseded by [NNNN](NNNN-title.md)`.
- Context: the requirements and constraints that made the choice necessary.
- Decision: one or two sentences in active voice: "We use X for Y."
- Alternatives: every rejected option with the concrete reason it lost.
- Never rewrite an accepted ADR: write a new one and mark the old one superseded.

```md
<!-- Bad: topic as title, no alternatives -->

# 0003. Transport

We talked about transports and WebSockets seem good.

<!-- Good -->

# 0003. Use WebSocket between the SDK and the hub

## Decision

We use one WebSocket per SDK instance, opened by its connector to the hub.

## Alternatives

- **HTTP polling** — breakpoint changes would reach the SDK only on the next poll; latency or load, never both low.
- **HTTP + Server-Sent Events** — two channels to keep in sync and SSE is one-way.
