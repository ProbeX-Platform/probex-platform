# 0009. Run the hub handshake in the connector

## Status

Accepted · 2026-10-21

## Context

On every connection the hub needs to know which app instance it talks to and which protocol version the session
uses before it handles other messages. Its first frame must therefore be the handshake, even when messages queued
while the hub was unreachable are waiting. The `Connector` interface takes messages one by one and has no way to
send a message ahead of its queue. The hub targets breakpoints by service and labels.

## Decision

We run the handshake in `HubConnector`: after every connect it sends `hello` as the first frame, with protocol
version, service, labels and instance details, and reports `connected` and sends queued messages only after the
hub replies `welcome`.

## Alternatives

- **The debugger sends `hello` when the status becomes `connected`** — queued messages could reach the hub before
  `hello`, unless `Connector` gains a way to send a message first, which changes a public interface every
  connector implements.
- **Identity in the upgrade request's headers or query** — labels need their own encoding into headers, which
  proxies limit in size and may strip, and a query string ends up in access logs, the reason the token is not there
  ([ADR 0006](0006-authenticate-to-the-hub-with-a-bearer-token.md)).

## Consequences

- `connected` means the hub has accepted the session, not just that a socket is open.
- Service and labels are connector options with `PROBEX_SERVICE` and `PROBEX_LABELS`; both are public API.
- A custom connector that talks to a ProbeX hub implements the same handshake, described in the protocol API.
- Neither side sends anything else before `welcome`; any other frame first closes the session with
  `protocolError`.
- A hub that has no types for the `hello`'s version closes with `incompatibleVersion`; the connector logs an error
  and keeps retrying at `reconnect.maxDelayMs`, so it recovers once the hub supports that version.
