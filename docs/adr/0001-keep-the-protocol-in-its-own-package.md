# 0001. Keep the protocol in its own package

## Status

Accepted · 2026-10-21

## Context

The SDK and the hub are separate programs that talk only through messages carried by a connector, so both of them
and every connector must agree on the message types, the protocol version and the `Connector` interface. The SDK
ships a default connector; users can replace it with their own. The hub runs outside the host app and must not need
debugger runtime code. Whatever holds these types is public API, and changes to it decide whether old and new peers still understand
each other.

## Decision

We keep the message types, `PROTOCOL_VERSION`, the `Connector` interface and the data types carried in messages in
`@probex/protocol`, a types-only package that every side depends on. It holds only what both ends of the wire must
agree on.

## Alternatives

- **Types in `@probex/sdk`** — the hub and custom connectors would install the debugger runtime to get the message
  types and the `Connector` interface, and every SDK release would look like a protocol change.
- **A general `@probex/shared` for anything two packages use** — helpers and internal types would pile up next to
  the protocol, every change would touch all packages, it would be unclear which changes break compatibility, and
  all of it would become public API.

## Consequences

- The SDK, custom connectors and the hub import `@probex/protocol` and never each other for protocol types.
- A protocol change is visible as a change to one small package and is checked against `PROTOCOL_VERSION`.
- Small helpers used by several packages are duplicated or kept in their owner instead of being shared here.
- One more package to version and publish.
- Follow-up: rename `packages/shared` (`@probex/shared`) to `packages/protocol` (`@probex/protocol`), with its
  dependents, `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/rules/shared.md`.
