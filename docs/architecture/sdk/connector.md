# Connector

## Purpose

`HubConnector` is the SDK's default [`Connector`](../../api/protocol.md#connector): it carries protocol messages
between the [debugger](debugger.md) in the host app and the hub over one WebSocket. The SDK creates it from its own
config; developers create it themselves only to use it without the debugger, such as in a tool or a test. How to use
it: [API](../../api/sdk/connector.md).

## Boundaries

- Owns:
  - the WebSocket to the hub: TLS, the bearer token in the upgrade request, reconnects with backoff, liveness pings;
  - the session on each connection: the `hello` → `welcome` handshake and the protocol version check;
  - outgoing messages: serialization, the control queue and the data buffer, batching and the rate limit;
  - handing incoming messages and status changes to handlers;
  - deciding what it logs and at which level.
- Does not own:
  - message types, `PROTOCOL_VERSION` and close codes: the [protocol](../protocol.md);
  - what is sent and what an incoming message means, including re-applying breakpoints after a reconnect: the
    [debugger](debugger.md);
  - process signals and shutdown: the host app calls `close()`, directly or through the SDK;
  - filtering, collapsing and writing log lines: the [logger](logger.md).
- Constraints:
  - Never throws into the host app and `close()` never rejects. Every problem is logged through the
    [logger](logger.md): failures at `error`, problems the connector recovers from at `warn`.
  - Never blocks the event loop: `send()` only serializes the message once and queues it, building a log message
    only when its level is enabled. Batches are built and written from a timer or `setImmediate`, never inside
    `send()`; all I/O is asynchronous.
  - Never keeps the host process alive: the socket and every timer are unref'd, except while `close()` flushes, see
    [Closing](#closing). A DNS lookup or a TCP connect in progress cannot be unref'd and may hold a process that is
    otherwise done until it ends, a connect for at most 10 s. A closing socket holds it for at most 1 s while the
    hub answers the closing handshake.
  - Memory is bounded: the data buffer by `buffer.maxMessages` and `buffer.maxBytes`, the control queue by 200
    messages of at most 4 KiB each, incoming frames by 1 MiB.
  - Imports only `@probex-platform/protocol`, `ws`, the SDK [logger](logger.md) and Node built-ins. The logger
    imports no SDK module, so both can move to their own package.
  - TLS certificates are always verified; custom CAs come from `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`. Redirects are not followed.
  - The token is never logged and never sent over `ws://` to a host other than loopback: `localhost`, `127.0.0.0/8`
    or `[::1]`, matched by name without a DNS lookup. URLs are logged as origin and path only, never with userinfo or
    query; headers of the upgrade response and the hub's close reason are never logged. Userinfo in the URL is never
    sent.
  - WebSocket compression is off: it costs CPU and memory in the host app.
  - Connects to the hub directly; HTTP(S) proxies (`HTTPS_PROXY`) are not supported.
  - Delivery is at most once: a message lost with a dropped socket is not resent.

```

The debugger sees only the [`Connector`](../../api/protocol.md#connector) interface. On the wire every frame is one
JSON protocol message or a [`Batch`](../../api/protocol.md#batch) of them.

## Key flows

### Connecting

1. `connect()` checks the URL resolved in the constructor and returns. No URL, a URL that is not `ws://` or
   `wss://`, a token with `ws://` to a non-loopback host, or a token an HTTP header cannot carry: an error is logged,
   nothing is opened, and the status stays `disconnected`.
2. After `connect()` returns, the status becomes `connecting`. The connector opens the WebSocket with
   `Authorization: Bearer <token>` when a token is set, and unrefs the socket.
3. Once open, it sends [`hello`](../../api/protocol.md#hello) as the first frame: protocol version, service, labels,
   instance id, hostname, pid, SDK and Node versions.
4. The hub replies [`welcome`](../../api/protocol.md#welcome). The status becomes `connected` and the queued
   messages start to flow.
5. The hub sends the full breakpoint state; the debugger applies it. This happens after every connect, so nothing
   has to survive a disconnect.
6. On failure, or when a live connection drops, the status becomes `disconnected` and the next attempt waits the
   current delay. The delay starts at `reconnect.minDelayMs`, doubles after each failed attempt up to
   `reconnect.maxDelayMs`, and goes back to `reconnect.minDelayMs` after a `welcome`. Each wait is a random value
   between half and all of the current delay.
   - unreachable hub, TLS error, an HTTP status other than 101, 401 or 403 on the upgrade, or no `welcome` within
     10 s: a warning;
   - HTTP 401 or 403 on the upgrade, a frame before `welcome` or a `welcome` of another version, a message of another
     version after `welcome`, close code `incompatibleVersion` or `protocolError`, or an incoming frame over 1 MiB: an
     error, and the delay jumps to `reconnect.maxDelayMs`. The connector keeps trying, so it recovers when the token
     or the hub is fixed.

### Sending a message

1. `send(message)` serializes the message once. If `JSON.stringify` throws or returns no string, an error is logged
   and the message is dropped. A `hello` is dropped with a warning: the connector sends its own.
2. Data messages (snapshots) go to the data buffer. When it is full by `buffer.maxMessages` or `buffer.maxBytes`,
   the oldest data messages are dropped and a warning is logged. A single data message larger than
   `buffer.maxBytes` is dropped with a warning.
3. All other messages are control messages (breakpoint status, errors) and go to the control queue, so a burst of
   snapshots cannot hide a breakpoint's status from the hub. A queued `breakpointStatus` is replaced in its place by a
   newer one for the same `breakpointId`, so the queue holds at most one per breakpoint. Data never pushes control
   messages out; when 200 are waiting, the oldest is dropped and a warning is logged. A control message over 4 KiB is
   dropped with a warning. A new message type is control unless the connector lists it as data.
4. While `connected`, the batcher runs `batch.flushIntervalMs` after the first queued message, or at once from
   `setImmediate` when `batch.maxMessages` or `batch.maxBytes` are queued. It builds a batch only when the token
   bucket and the socket allow it, so messages wait in the queue and the buffer until then and a newer control
   message still goes first.
5. A batch takes control messages first, then data, up to `batch.maxMessages` and `batch.maxBytes`, which counts the
   frame's UTF-8 size with its `batch` envelope; a single message larger than `batch.maxBytes` goes on its own. It is
   written when the socket is open and has less than `batch.maxBytes` unsent, so a socket the hub is closing gets
   nothing and the messages wait for the next `welcome`. One message goes as itself, several as a `batch` frame.
6. The token bucket holds up to one second of `rateLimit.bytesPerSecond`. A frame larger than that waits for a full
   bucket and leaves it in debt, so a large snapshot is delayed, never stuck.
7. Messages already handed to the socket when it drops are lost; queued ones wait for the next `welcome`.

### Receiving a message

1. A frame larger than 1 MiB closes the connection with code 1009 and an error; the delay jumps to
   `reconnect.maxDelayMs` and the connector reconnects.
2. Before `welcome`, any other frame, or a `welcome` whose `version` is not `PROTOCOL_VERSION`, closes the socket
   with `protocolError`, logs an error and counts as a failed attempt: the delay jumps to `reconnect.maxDelayMs`.
   `welcome` is not passed to handlers; a later one is ignored at `debug`.
3. After `welcome`, a binary frame, a frame that is not valid JSON, has no numeric `version` or no string `type`, or
   a type the SDK sends (`hello`, `batch`, `breakpointStatus`, `snapshot`) is logged as a warning and ignored.
4. A message whose `version` is not `PROTOCOL_VERSION` closes the session with `protocolError` and an error, like a
   `welcome` of another version: a session speaks one version
   ([ADR 0016](../../adr/0016-use-the-hellos-protocol-version-for-the-session.md)).
5. A message with an unknown `type` is logged at `debug` and ignored, so older SDKs keep working with newer hubs.
   The connector module holds the list of types the hub sends.
6. Every other message goes to each `onMessage` handler, in the order they subscribed, checked for its `version`
   and `type` only: the [debugger](debugger.md) checks the other fields when it interprets the message. Handlers are
   called from a copy of the list, so one that unsubscribes or calls `close()` does not skip the others. A handler
   that throws is logged; the others still run. Status changes reach `onStatus` handlers the same way.

### Detecting a dead connection

1. While open, the connector sends a WebSocket ping every 15 s.
2. If nothing arrives from the hub within 10 s of a ping, neither a pong, a ping nor a message, it drops the socket
   with a warning and reconnects after the current delay, like after any dropped connection.

### Closing

1. `close()` stops reconnecting and pings. When `connected`, it refs the socket and a `closeTimeoutMs` timer, so
   the process stays alive while it sends queued messages, in batches and within the rate limit, for up to
   `closeTimeoutMs`. Otherwise the pending attempt or socket is cancelled at once and nothing is sent.
2. It drops what is left with a warning that says how many, closes the socket with code 1000, sets the status to
   `closed`, [flushes the logger](logger.md#flushing) and resolves.
3. The socket is terminated if the hub has not closed it within 1 s, so `close()` resolves within
   `closeTimeoutMs` + 1 s. A second call returns the same promise.
4. No handler is called after `close()` resolves; later `connect()` and `send()` calls log a warning and do nothing,
   and `onMessage()` and `onStatus()` return a function that does nothing.
